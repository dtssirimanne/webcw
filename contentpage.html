            <br>
            <p id="text2">Deliberate efforts are done in improving or returning natural habitats to a healthy state.Restoring degraded marine habitats such as mangroves, coral reefs, water waves and seagrass beds through replanting, artificial structures and habitat rehabilitation programs
                enhancing habitat quality through reducing pollution and managing invasive species by removing them. So, habitat restoration and enhancement are crucial for the conservation of both terrestial and aquatic environments. This is done to achieve the main goal which is to promote biodiversity, 
                and support the marine ecosystems. These efforts involve the collaboration of conservation organizations, government offices, stakeholders and other local institutes to obtain conservaiton targets and long-term sustainability of the aquatic organisms and their habitats.

            <br>
            <p id="text3">Reducing pollution in seas is a complex task that requires huge comprehensive stratergies, collaborative efforts and commitment from government institutes. This includes efforts to minimize the discharge of waste materials such as chemicals, plastics and other harmful components to the oceans. Establishing strict rules and regulations on 
                maritime activities, encompassing regulations on waste management and promoting sustainable practices in agricultre and in industries are some important techniques to minimize marine pollution. Apart form that, activities such as recycling programs, innovative techniques for waste management and beach clean-ups can be organized avoiding ocean pollution. However, the ultimate
                aim is to protect and ensure the sustainability of aquatic organisms and their natural habitats for both present and future generations.

            <br>
            <p id="text4">Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) are regions that are designated with seas, oceans or other water bodies that are legally managed and protected to conserve the manage the marine biodiversity sustainably. These are established to safeguard unprotected 
                species, preserve critical habitats and maintain the ecological balance of marine systems. Activities such as fishing, mining and other extractive industries are being restricted to a certain extent in order to reduce the impact that is caused by humans to the marine ecosystems.
                Providing opportunities for education and scientific research, supporting biodiversity and marine conservation are some of the important roles served by MPAs. These are established to manage the marine resources effectively for long-term sustainability.

            <br>
            <p id="text5">Sustainable fishery management includes adopting policies that ensure the long-term health of the aquatic organinsm and thir habitats. Setting catch limits, establishing protectes areas, rules to minimize habitat damage and promoting awareness among the community can be set as key elements of sustainable fishery management.
                All the above mentioned techniques are taken to meet the current demands without damaging the capacity of susequent generations to satisfy their own balance among social, economic and ecological parts of fishing. In conclusion, this stratergy aids to minimize environmental effects and protects local fisherman while maintaining the greatest 
                number of fish that can be gathered while maintaining future productivity.
